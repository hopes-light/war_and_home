# How to make a glorified waiting room...
# Goal is to catch people when they reach the current campaign end and then send
# them here as a buffer scenario that points to the next which then will point
# to nothing
# When there is an update, the save is in this scenario and it points to the
# second which then points to the first new scenario of the update
# A buffer scenario because the next_scenario value is in the save and thus it
# can't be changed if the next scenario changes (say update adding scenarios)
