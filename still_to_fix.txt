For later:
Scenario 10: Make some sort of ending slides if the final boss is killed
Scenario 35: Make ferry system more multiplayer-friendly? (side 3 becomes side 2 if MP)... unsure what I meant here
Scenario 4: Review it, it's really easy
Scenario 32: Make human general (HL1) separate from side 1, 2
             Explain why should beat enemy forces
Scenario 33: Make autumn shyde separate from sides 1, 2
Scenario "45": Maybe make a special ending slide for Wolfie (traveled often with HR, but over time started spending more and more time by the fire in Merlyc)
Scenario "43" and "44": More banter with UL1, UL2, MK, BB -> Mostly done

General: Specifically in later parts: add some stuff to liven things up (varied objectives, different mechanics, some items)
General: Remove warning about work-in-progress in first scenario
