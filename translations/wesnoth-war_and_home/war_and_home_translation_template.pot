"If you have a save from an older version (pre 0.2.0) then some things might not work (I added a new 'first' scenario and I had messed up a few things), but it should be obvious if that's the case (the 'your heroes all being level 1 with no xp' kind of obvious). It should be fixable by reloading a save before the 'waiting' scenario but I'm not sure, sorry...\n"
