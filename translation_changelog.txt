0.7.0 -> 0.8.0
    "forces to the North are too" -> "forces to the north are too" (capitalization)

    "one of their leader" -> "one of their leaders" (plural)
    "'ve" to "have"
    "Elaessa, ready to fight?" -> "(<i>To Elaessa</i>) Ready to fight?"

    All of these should already be fixed in the po/pot files packaged with the addon:
    Removal of double spaces
    Wesntoh -> Wesnoth


Started noting it down at this point
